# Optical Flow Object Tracking

A computer vision project that demonstrates object tracking using Optical Flow to detect motion across sequential video frames. This implementation uses the **Lucas–Kanade method** to track feature points and visualize motion vectors.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects and tracks motion between consecutive video frames.
- Uses **Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow** for stable tracking of objects.
- Visualizes direction and magnitude of movement using vector lines.
- Real-time processing support using OpenCV.
